# Wrapping Up

Let's wrap up real quick by finishing up our .env file.

---

### **Site URL and Functions URL**

The Nextjs project utilizes server side api calls, this means we need a fully qualified URL to hit our own API.

To solve this we have these two env variables

```sh
# Firebase Functions
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5001/<project-id>/<region>"

# Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

When developing locally, you want these variables to reference localhost (as they already do).

The only one you need to update for local development is the Firebase Functions Base url

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“£">
  {" "}
  You'll find project-id in your environment variables for the firebase config.

The region is the region you setup on Firebase's console when creating your project. It's like **us-central1** if you're in the USA.

</Callout>

When deploying, you should update these to the deployed url, for example.

If your url is https://mycoolsaas.com

Your env var would look like this

```sh
# Firebase Functions - baseUrl that allows you hit firebase functions via HTTPS
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL="https://<region>-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net"

# Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://mycoolsaas.com"
```

### **Congrats**

Your project should be setup to run, hit `yarn dev` and see if everything works properly. Now it's your turn to make something cool!
