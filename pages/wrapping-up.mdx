# Wrapping Up

Let's wrap up real quick by finishing up our .env file.

---

### **Site URL and Functions URL**

You should have these as localhost for local .env

When deploying, you should update these to the deployed url ie. https://firesaas.dev

### **Congrats**

Your project should be setup to run, hit `yarn dev` and see if everything works properly. Now it's your turn to make something cool!
