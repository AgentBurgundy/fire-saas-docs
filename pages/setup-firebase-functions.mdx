# Setting Up Firebase Functions

Working with functions is meant to be easy in **FireSaaS**. This guide will go over deploying the new user created function and working with / adding new functions.

  I prepackaged one function in this project. It creates database entries for your users when they create an account. Let's go ahead and deploy that now.

### **Node Version**

I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or if you're on Windows [NVM-for-Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) if you don't already to manage your node versions.

Firebase Functions requires Node 18, so make sure you have Node 18 installed globally
or install it via NVM and use it.

```sh copy
nvm install 18
```

```sh copy
nvm use 18
```

### **Setup Firebase CLI**

Make sure you have the Firebase CLI setup

```sh copy
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

This installs firebase globally on your machine.

Now we login

```sh copy
firebase login
```

Once you're logged in, cd into the functions directory

Then we can cd into functions and run yarn deploy, once this finishes your functions are live.

```sh copy
cd functions
```

You MUST run yarn first to install dependencies.

```sh copy
yarn
```

Then you can run deploy to deploy your functions to Firebase.

```sh copy
yarn deploy
```

  To deploy functions your Firebase account has to be on the **Blaze** account (Pay
  as you Go). Running deploy will prompt you to set this up if it isn't already.

### **Testing Functions Locally**

You can run `yarn serve` inside the functions project to emulate functions locally. This is good for testing stuff out before you deploy.

```sh copy
yarn serve
```
