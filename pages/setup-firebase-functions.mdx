  I prepackaged one function in this project. It creates database entries for your users when they create an account. Let's go ahead and deploy that now.

### **Adding Project ID**

First we have to open the `.firebaserc` file inside the project.

Add your project id here, you should have your project id in your Environment Variables already so copy it from there.

```JSON
// .firebaserc
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "<PROJECT-ID-HERE>"
  }
}
```

### **Setup Firebase CLI**

Make sure you have the Firebase CLI setup

```sh copy
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

This installs firebase globally on your machine.

Now we login

```sh copy
firebase login
```

Once you're logged in, cd into the functions directory

Then we can cd into functions and run yarn deploy, once this finishes your functions are live.

```sh copy
cd functions
```

```sh copy
yarn deploy
```

---

### **Testing Functions Locally**

You can run `yarn serve` inside the functions project to emulate functions locally. This is good for testing stuff out before you deploy.

```sh copy
yarn serve
```
